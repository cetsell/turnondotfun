Description: Break down scenes, components, and utilities into small, reusable files to avoid a monolithic structure. Update architecture.md with new file purposes as they are created.

When to Apply: Use when creating or modifying components, scenes, or utilities that could be split into multiple files.

File Pattern: Applies to .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx in src/components, src/scenes, and src/utils.

Reference Files: @architecture.md for documenting file purposes; @implementation-plan.md for aligning with modular steps.

Rationale: Ensures scalability and maintainability by preventing a single giant file. Keeps architecture.md as a living reference.
