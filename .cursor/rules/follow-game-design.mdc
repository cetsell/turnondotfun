Description: Adhere to the core mechanics and UI specifications outlined in game-design-document.md. Update it if design changes occur during implementation.

When to Apply: Use when designing scenes, interactions, or UI elements to align with the base game design.

File Pattern: Applies to all files in src/scenes, src/components, and src/ui.

Reference Files: @game-design-document.md for design reference; @progress.md to track implementation alignment.

Rationale: Keeps development consistent with the agreed-upon game vision and ensures documentation evolves with the project.
