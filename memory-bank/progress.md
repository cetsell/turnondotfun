## Technical Challenges & Notes

1. **Hyperfy Integration**: 
   - Leveraging Hyperfy's powerful built-in capabilities
   - Need to regularly pull the newest releases to stay current
   - Recently added view features should help with marketplace implementation
   - Shop/inventory features from Hyperfy will be integrated into our game systems

2. **Asset Management**:
   - Using Hyperfy's local file requirements
   - Plan to bundle assets into .hyp app files for level packaging
   - Marketplace and file/metadata management will use Supabase

3. **State Management**:
   - Using Supabase tables for state persistence
   - Need to implement proper synchronization between client and server state

## Next Priorities

1. Complete custom HUD implementation (Step 8)
2. Finalize asset management system integration with Supabase
3. Begin implementing characters in the game world (Step 10)
4. Design and implement the conversation interface (Step 12)
